   * Only way that I could think of to tell the direction of movement is based on what happens after both sensors read the same value (both HIGH/LOW)

   * 
   * If both sensors are the same: previousPos = 1
   * This lets me use previousPos to check what happens next. Depending on what sensor changes first, the direction can be determined.
